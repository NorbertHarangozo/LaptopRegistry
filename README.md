# LaptopRegistry

This application is a laptop inventory management tool using Spring MVC and Spring REST.

The goal of this project is to get more familiar with Java and the Spring Framework.  
It also serves as my assignment to complete the **Framework based programming** course in **Eszterházy Károly University**.  

The application is using a MySQL database. To get it working, **make sure to rename hibernate-example.properties to hibernate.properties in the dao/src/main/resources directory.**  
Once that's done, don't forget to set the appropriate credentials in there.

To access the MVC side of things, go to **/web_war/Laptops**, and to access the REST API, go to **/web_war/REST/Laptops**.

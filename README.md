# LaptopRegistry

The goal of this project is to get more familiar with Java and the Spring Framework.  
It also serves as my assignment to complete the **Framework based programming** course in **Eszterházy Károly University**.  

The application is using a MySQL database. To get it working, **make sure to rename hibernate-example.properties to hibernate.properties in the dao/src/main/resources directory.**  
Once that's done, don't forget to set the appropriate credentials in there.
